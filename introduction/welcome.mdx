### Versioning

This documentation is for V4 of the SDK. Therefore we assume you have [the latest version of V4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core?activeTab=versions) installed.

If you are looking for V3, please go [here](https://v3.docs.dynamic.xyz)

Please also make sure you have all @dynamic/labs packages on exactly the same version to avoid any issues, and use [Dynamic Doctor](/troubleshooting/dynamic-doctor) for easy debugging. Happy building!

### What is Chipi Pay?

Chipi Pay offers smart and beautiful login flows for crypto-native users, simple
onboarding flows for everyone else, and powerful developer tools that go beyond
authentication.
