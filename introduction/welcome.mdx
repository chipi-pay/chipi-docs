### What is Chipi Pay?

Chipi SDK combines invisible wallet creation with social login and Avnu's gasless to streamline dApp development on StarkNet.
Users log in with familiar accounts (Google, X, Meta), and a wallet is generated behind the scenes‚Äîno manual key management needed.
Focus on building features instead of dealing with blockchain complexities.

## Features

- üîê **Invisible Wallet Creation**: Generate wallets automatically with social login
- üí∏ **Gasless Transactions**: Integration with Avnu Gasless
- üîÑ **Simple Transfers**: Simplified API for token transfers
- ‚ö° **Optimized for StarkNet**: Designed specifically for the StarkNet network
