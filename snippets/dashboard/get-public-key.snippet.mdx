<Step title="Get your Public Key" titleSize="h2">

    Now go to your [Api Keys](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/api-keys) and click on your project.

    Which will give you access to your **Public Key** (`pk_prod_xxxx`). Keep this handy as you'll need it to initialize the SDK.

    <Info>
    You won't need the Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`) for now.
