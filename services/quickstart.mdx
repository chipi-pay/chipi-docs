# Setup Process

## 1. Setup Buying Services in the Dashboard

First, create your organization in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/).

Next, head to [Services Settings](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/skus)

You'll need to add a Webhook URL to where you want to receive updates on the status of the purchase of services.

</div>

Which will give you access to your Api keys.

For Buying Services, you'll only need your Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`). 


<Tip>
  For testing purposes, set your environment to development in the dashboard. 
  This will give you a secret key that doesn't require a valid transaction hash,
   making it easier to test the endpoints without needing to process actual transactions.
</Tip>

Keep this handy as you'll need it to authenticate API Requests to buy services.

You won't need your Public Key (`pk_prod_xxxx`) for now. In coming weeks we'll be adding a way to buy services inside our SDK using both keys.




## 2. Use the Secret Key to call the Chipi Pay API to buy services

There are 2 main endpoints you'll need to call to buy services. You can check the [API Reference](/api-reference) for more details on the endpoints and how to use them.

### 1. Get Skus

Typescript Example:
```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.chipipay.com/v1/skus", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer sk_prod_xxxx`
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

This will return a list of SKUs that are available for purchase. 
You will need the <code>sku_id</code> to buy a service.
The rest of the fields are useful for displaying the service details to the user.


### 2. Buy a Service

Before calling this endpoint, you'll need to use our Smart Contract to pay for the required service. 

You can find the Starknet Smart Contract [here](https://github.com/chipipay/chipipay-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ChipiPay.sol).

You can find the EVM Smart Contract [here](https://github.com/chipipay/chipipay-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ChipiPay.sol).


Once you have the transaction hash, you can call the endpoint to buy the service.

Typescript Example:
```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.chipipay.com/v1/sku-transactions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer sk_prod_xxxx`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "walletAddress": "wallet-address",
    "skuId": "sku-tl-TEL010", // The SKU ID of the service you want to buy
    "chain": "STARKNET", // For now only Starknet is supported
    "chainToken": "USDC", // For now only USDC is supported
    "mxnAmount": 10
    "reference": "7773271789"
    "transactionHash": "0x1234567890" // This is the transaction hash of the transaction that will be used to sponsor the transaction
    })
});

const data = await response.json();
```

Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll receive a response with the status of the transaction in your <b>webhook URL</b>.

You can check the [API Reference](/api-reference) for more details on the endpoints and how to use them.
