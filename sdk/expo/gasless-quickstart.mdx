<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication" titleSize="h2">

You'll need to [add the JWKS Endpoint](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/jwks-endpoint) from your Auth Provider to authenticate gasless transactions.

<Tip>
  With this JWKS Endpoint setup, you can now run secure code in your frontend
  using a rotating JWT token.
</Tip>

### Getting your JWKS Endpoint

For these common Auth Providers, you can get your JWKS Endpoint like this:

<Step title="Get your Public Key" titleSize="h2">

Now go to your [Api Keys](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/api-keys) and click on your project.

Which will give you access to your **Public Key** (`pk_prod_xxxx`). Keep this handy as you'll need it to initialize the SDK.

<Info>
 You won't need the Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`) for now.

</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h2">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @chipi-stack/chipi-expo@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @chipi-stack/chipi-expo@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @chipi-stack/chipi-expo@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the SDK" titleSize="h2">

1. Add your **Public Key** to your environment variables.

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_CHIPI_API_KEY=pk_prod_xxxx
```

2. Wrap your main `_layout.tsx` with the `ChipiProvider` component.

```tsx
// app/_layout.tsx

import { ChipiProvider } from "@chipi-stack/chipi-expo";

const API_PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CHIPI_API_KEY;
if (!API_PUBLIC_KEY) throw new Error("API_PUBLIC_KEY is not set");


export default function RootLayout() {
  // ...
  return (
    <ChipiProvider
      config={{
        apiPublicKey: API_PUBLIC_KEY,
      }}
    >
      <Stack />;
    </ChipiProvider>
  );
}

```
