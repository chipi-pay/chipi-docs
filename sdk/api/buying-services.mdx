### Purchase Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Services" titleSize="h2">
    Use the `GET /skus` endpoint to retrieve the list of available services.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">
    
    ```ts
    const response = await fetch("https://api.chipipay.com/v1/skus", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer sk_prod_xxxx`
      }
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    ```
    
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
    
    ```python
    import requests

    url = "https://api.chipipay.com/v1/skus"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_prod_xxxx"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    ```
    
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  <Tip>
  This will return a list of SKUs that are available for purchase. 
  You will need the <code>sku_id</code> to buy a service.
  The rest of the fields are useful for displaying the service details to the user.
  </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Pay the crypto Amount for the desired service" titleSize="h2">
  Before you can complete the purchase, you must deposit the exact crypto amount required for the selected service into the Chipi Pay smart contract. 

  This payment must be made **on-chain** using your wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive a **transaction hash** from the blockchain. This hash serves as proof of payment and will be validated by our backend when you finalize the purchase.

  <Tip>
    Make sure to send the exact amount specified for the service. Sending an incorrect amount may result in a failed or delayed purchase.
  </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Purchase" titleSize="h2">
    Use the `POST /buy-sku` endpoint to complete the transaction.
  Use the transaction hash from step 2 and call the endpoint to buy the service.

    <Tab title="TypeScript">
    
    ```ts
    const response = await fetch("https://api.chipipay.com/v1/sku-transactions", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer sk_prod_xxxx`
      },

      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
    
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://api.chipipay.com/v1/sku-transactions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_prod_xxxx",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "walletAddress": "0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7",

    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    data = response.json()
    ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll receive a response with the status of the transaction in your <b>webhook URL</b>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Status" titleSize="h2">
    Track the purchase status through webhooks and API responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Next Steps

- Review the [Get SKUs](/sdk/api/endpoint/get-skus) endpoint documentation
- Learn about the [Buy SKU](/sdk/api/endpoint/buy-sku) endpoint
- Set up webhook endpoints in your dashboard
- Test the integration using our development environment

<Tip>
  Start with the development environment to test your integration without processing real transactions. This allows you to verify your implementation before going live.
</Tip>

If you need to do something more customized, we are developing a more comprehensive API.
