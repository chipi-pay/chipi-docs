All API requests require authentication using your API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting Your API Key

To use the Chipi Pay API, you'll need to obtain your API key from the dashboard.

#### Steps to Get Your API Key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Go to the [Configure API Keys](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/api-keys) section in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Inside you will see API Keys:
    - Public Key: Can be safely shared and is used to identify your application
    - **Secret Key**: This is your API Key. This is the key you will use to authenticate all the calls to our API
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Never commit your API key to version control or share it publicly. Always use environment variables or secure configuration management.
