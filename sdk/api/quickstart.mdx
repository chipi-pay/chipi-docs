# API Quickstart

Welcome to the Chipi API! This guide will help you get started with integrating our services into your application.

## Overview

The Chipi API provides programmatic access to our payment and wallet services. You can use it to:

- Create and manage wallets
- Process payments and transactions
- Handle webhooks for real-time updates
- Manage SKUs and products
- Integrate with various blockchain networks

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up for a Chipi account at [dashboard.chipipay.com](https://dashboard.chipipay.com)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code

## Base URL

```
https://api.chipipay.com/v1
```

## Making Your First Request

Let's start with a simple example - getting available SKUs:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chipipay.com/v1/skus" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error messages:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

- **Free tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro tier**: 1000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit headers are included in responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## SDKs and Libraries

We provide official SDKs for popular platforms:

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```bash
npm install @chipi/sdk
```

### React Hooks
```bash
npm install @chipi/react
```

### Python
```bash
pip install chipi-sdk
```

## Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time updates about events:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks",
  "events": ["payment.completed", "wallet.created"],
  "secret": "your_webhook_secret"
}
```

## Testing

Use our sandbox environment for testing:

```
https://sandbox-api.chipipay.com/v1
```

Sandbox API keys are clearly marked and won't process real transactions.
