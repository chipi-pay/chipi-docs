# NextJS SDK

Our NextJS SDK allows you to create Self-custodial Wallets and sign transactions
without the need for gas. 
You can then use the Chipi Dashboard to manage your wallets and transactions. 
As well as see analytics on your transactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our NextJs is a simple wrapper around the Chipi API.
It is designed to be used with the Chipi Dashboard,
which is a web-based dashboard for setting up your project.
Simply follow the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](/sdk/nextjs/gasless) to get started.

If you wish to use an unlisted Programming Language, you can use the Chipi API directly.
