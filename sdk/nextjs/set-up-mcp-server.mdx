title: "Set Up MCP Server "
description: "This guide explains how to set up and use an MCP (Model Component Protocol) server with our deployed registry. MCP enables you to integrate custom UI components, utilities, and APIs into your project using standardized registries."
---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or pnpm as a package manager
- A project with Next.js (or your framework of choice) already initialized
- Tailwind CSS configured (if you plan to use Shadcn-style components)


<Note>
  The MCP server provides a bridge between your development environment and our component registry, enabling seamless integration of Chipi components into your projects.

## Setup the Chipi MCP Server
<Steps>
<Step title="Configure MCP in Cursor" titleSize="h2">
 Click the button below to install the Chipi MCP server in your Cursor 
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=chipiMcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IG1jcC1yZW1vdGUgaHR0cHM6Ly9jaGlwaS12MC1zaGFkY24udmVyY2VsLmFwcC9tY3AiLCJlbnYiOnt9fQ%3D%3D)

</Step>



<Step title="Inside your project, Create a components.json file using this command" titleSize="h2">

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
</CodeGroup>


</Step>


<Step title="Add chipi to your registries section in components.json" titleSize="h2">


   ```json
    "registries": {
    "@chipi": "https://chipi-v0-shadcn.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
   ```

</Step>
<Step title="After installation, you can ask" titleSize="h2">

Once the Chipi MCP server is installed, Cursor acts as your assistant for working with Chipi.
You can now:

- 🔍 **Discover** what’s in the registry — *“What components are available in Chipi?”*  
- 📥 **Install** components into your project — *“Add the PayCryptoButton to my project.”*  
- 🛠️ **Get usage examples** — *“Show me how to use Chipi’s base provider with Next.js.”*  
- 📚 **Read documentation** — *“What props does PayCryptoButton accept?”*  
- 🧪 **Debug your setup** — *“Check if my Chipi Pay config is correct.”*  

This means you don’t have to memorize commands or file paths — just ask Cursor, and it will fetch, install, and explain Chipi components directly in your project.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Registry not loading**: Check your internet connection and registry URL.
- **Components not found**: Ensure the MCP server is running.
- **Styling issues**: Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured.
