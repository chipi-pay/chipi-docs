title: "Set Up the Chipi MCP Server"
description: "This guide walks you through setting up and using the Chipi MCP (Model Component Protocol) server. With it, you can seamlessly integrate Chipi’s UI components, utilities, and APIs into your project via standardized registries."
---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- A project already initialized with Next.js
- An Account at [ChipiPay Dashboard](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/)
- A created project in [clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- npm or pnpm as a package manager
- Tailwind CSS configured 


<Note>
  The MCP server provides a bridge between your development environment and our component registry, enabling seamless integration of Chipi components into your projects.

## Setup the Chipi MCP Serve

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure MCP in Cursor" titleSize="h2">
Click the button below to install the Chipi MCP server in Cursor.
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=chipiMcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IG1jcC1yZW1vdGUgaHR0cHM6Ly9tY3AuY2hpcGlwYXkuY29tL21jcCIsImVudiI6e319)

</Step>



<Step title="Inside your project, create a components.json file by running:" titleSize="h2">

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
</CodeGroup>


</Step>


<Step title="Add chipi to the registries section in components.json" titleSize="h2">


   ```json
    "registries": {
    "@chipi": "https://mcp.chipipay.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
   ```

</Step>
<Step title="After installation, you can ask" titleSize="h2">

Once the Chipi MCP server is installed, Cursor acts as your assistant for working with Chipi.
You can now:

- 🔍 **Discover** what’s in the registry — *“What components are available in chipiMcp list all of them”*  
- 📥 **Install** all components and hooks into your project — *“Install all components, hooks, and utilities from chipiMcp to set up a fully custom crypto-enabled app. ”*  
- 🛠️ **Get usage examples** — *“Show me how to use Chipi’s Baseprovider with Next.js.”*  
- 📚 **Read documentation** — *“What props does PayCryptoButton accept?”*  
- 🧪 **Debug your setup** — *“Check if my Chipi Pay config is correct, check if I am using and installing all correct dependecies from chipiMcp and chipi registry.json”*  

This means you don’t have to memorize commands or file paths — just ask Cursor, and it will fetch, install, and explain Chipi components directly in your project.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Registry not loading**: Check your internet connection and registry URL.
- **Components not found**: Ensure the MCP server is running.
- **Styling issues**: Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured.

<Warning>
If you’re using an older version of Node.js or run into issues adding the MCP registry in Cursor settings, you can ask Cursor to fetch the registry manually by pasting this curl command into your prompt
</Warning>

 ```bash
curl -s "https://mcp.chipipay.com/r/registry.json" | jq '.items[] | {name, title, type}'
    ```
