<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication" titleSize="h2">

You'll need to [add the JWKS Endpoint](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/jwks-endpoint) from your Auth Provider to authenticate gasless transactions.

<Tip>
  With this JWKS Endpoint setup, you can now run secure code in your frontend
  using a rotating JWT token.
</Tip>

### Getting your JWKS Endpoint

For these common Auth Providers, you can get your JWKS Endpoint like this:

<Step title="Get your Public Key" titleSize="h2">

Now go to your [Api Keys](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/api-keys) and click on your project.

Which will give you access to your **Public Key** (`pk_prod_xxxx`). Keep this handy as you'll need it to initialize the SDK.

<Info>
 You won't need the Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`) for now.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h2">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @chipi-stack/nextjs
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @chipi-stack/nextjs
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @chipi-stack/nextjs
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the SDK" titleSize="h2">

1. Add your **Public Key** to your environment variables.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHIPI_API_KEY=pk_prod_xxxx
```



2. In your `layout.tsx`, wrap your app with the `ChipiProvider` component as shown below:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ChipiProvider>{children}</ChipiProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Celebrate & Learn More!" titleSize="h2">

That's it! You should now have an initial working version of Chipi Pay integrated into your application. You can now start implementing various features like:

- Wallet Creations
- Sending tokens
- Signing transactions
- and more!

<Tip>
  To quickly test the integration, you can use our [Test Mode](/test-mode) in
  development.
