<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication" titleSize="h2">

You'll need to [add the JWKS Endpoint](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/jwks-endpoint) from your Auth Provider to authenticate gasless transactions.

<Tip>
  With this JWKS Endpoint setup, you can now run secure code in your frontend
  using a rotating JWT token.
</Tip>

### Getting your JWKS Endpoint

For these common Auth Providers, you can get your JWKS Endpoint like this:

  <Tab title="Clerk">
  1. Go to your [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)

  2. Copy your **Jwks Url** and paste it into the JWKS Endpoint field in your Chipi Dashboard.

<Step title="Get your Public Key" titleSize="h2">

Now go to your [Api Keys](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/api-keys) and click on your project.

Which will give you access to your **Public Key** (`pk_prod_xxxx`). Keep this handy as you'll need it to initialize the SDK.

<Info>
 You won't need the Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`) for now.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h2">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @chipi/chipi-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @chipi/chipi-sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @chipi/chipi-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the SDK" titleSize="h2">

1. Add your **Public Key** to your environment variables.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHIPI_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_prod_xxxx
```

2. Create a `Providers.tsx` file to wrap your application.

```tsx
"use client";

import { ChipiProvider } from "@chipi-pay/chipi-sdk";

const API_PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CHIPI_PUBLIC_KEY
if (!API_PUBLIC_KEY) throw new Error("API_PUBLIC_KEY is not set");


export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ChipiProvider
      config={{
        apiPublicKey: API_PUBLIC_KEY,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ChipiProvider>
  );
}

```

3. In your `layout.tsx`, wrap your app with the `Providers` component as shown below:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Providers } from "./providers";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</Step>

That's it! You should now have an initial working version of Chipi Pay integrated into your application. You can now start implementing various features like:

- Wallet Creations
- Sending tokens
- Signing transactions
- and more!

<Tip>
  To quickly test the integration, you can use our [Test Mode](/test-mode) in
  development.
