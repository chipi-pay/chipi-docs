# React SDK

Our React SDK allows you to create Self-custodial Wallets and sign transactions
without the need for gas in web applications. 
You can then use the Chipi Dashboard to manage your wallets and transactions. 
As well as see analytics on your transactions. 

The Chipi React SDK is designed specifically for web applications, focusing on gasless transactions and wallet management for React apps.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our React SDK is a simple wrapper around the Chipi API, optimized for web development.
It is designed to be used with the Chipi Dashboard,
which is a web-based dashboard for setting up your project.
Simply follow the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](/sdk/react/gasless-quickstart) to get started.

If you wish to use an unlisted Programming Language, you can use the Chipi API directly.
