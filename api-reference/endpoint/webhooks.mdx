## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about the status of service purchases. When you configure a webhook URL in your dashboard, Chipi Pay will send POST requests to that URL whenever the status of a transaction changes.

## Webhook URL Configuration

Set your webhook URL in the [Services Settings](https://dashboard.chipipay.com/configure/skus) section of your dashboard.

## Webhook Payload

<ResponseExample url="your-webhook-url" method="POST">

```json Webhook Payload
{
  "event": "sku-transaction.completed",
  "data": {
    "skuTransactionId": "sku-tx-1234567890",
    "status": "TransactionStatus.COMPLETED"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Event Types

<ParamField body="event" type="string">
  The type of webhook event
</ParamField>

### Available Events

- `sku-transaction.completed` - SKU Transaction has been completed successfully
- `sku-transaction.failed` - SKU Transaction has failed

## Status Values

<ParamField body="data.status" type="string">
  Current status of the SKU Transaction
</ParamField>

### Available Statuses

- `PENDING` - SKU Transaction is being processed
- `COMPLETED` - SKU Transaction has been completed successfully
- `ERROR` - SKU Transaction has failed (check errorMessage for details)

## Response Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must return a `200 OK` status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook. 


<Warning>
  **Important:** Your webhook endpoint must respond within **30 seconds** or the delivery will be considered failed. Chipi Pay will attempt to deliver the webhook up to **3 times** before giving up.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Best Practices:**
  - Process webhooks asynchronously when possible
  - Return a 200 status immediately upon receipt
  - Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries
  - Log all webhook events for debugging
</Tip>


## Security

To verify that webhooks are coming from Chipi Pay, you can:

1. Check the IP address of the request
2. Verify the webhook signature (coming soon)
3. Validate the webhook payload structure

## Example Webhook Handler

```typescript
// Express.js example
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { event, data, timestamp } = req.body;
  
  switch (event) {
    case 'transaction.status_updated':
      handleStatusUpdate(data);
      break;
    case 'transaction.completed':
      handleTransactionCompleted(data);
      break;
    case 'transaction.failed':
      handleTransactionFailed(data);
      break;
  }
  
  // Always return 200 to acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
});

function handleStatusUpdate(data) {
  console.log(`Transaction ${data.id} status: ${data.status}`);
  // Update your database or notify your user
}

function handleTransactionCompleted(data) {
  console.log(`Service delivered for transaction ${data.id}`);
  console.log(`Reference: ${data.reference}`);
  console.log(`Amount: ${data.mxnAmount} MXN (${data.usdAmount} USD)`);
  console.log(`File Number: ${data.fileNumber || 'N/A'}`);
  // Notify user of successful service delivery
}

function handleTransactionFailed(data) {
  console.log(`Transaction ${data.id} failed`);
  console.log(`Error: ${data.errorMessage}`);
  // Handle failed transaction (refund, retry, etc.)
}
```

## Retry Logic

If your webhook endpoint is unavailable or returns an error status code, Chipi Pay will retry the webhook delivery.

After 3 failed attempts, the webhook will be marked as failed and no further retries will be attempted.

## Testing Webhooks

You can test your webhook endpoint using tools like:

- [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) - Temporary webhook URLs for testing
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) - Expose local endpoints to the internet
- [Postman](https://postman.com) - Mock webhook requests

<Tip>
  Make sure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and can handle POST requests with JSON payloads.
