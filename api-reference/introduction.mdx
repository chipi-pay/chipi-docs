# Chipi Pay API

Welcome to the Chipi Pay API! This API allows you to integrate service purchasing capabilities into your application.

## Base URL

```
https://api.chipipay.com/v1
```

## Overview

The Chipi Pay API provides endpoints for:

- **Getting Available Services**: Retrieve a list of services (SKUs) available for purchase
- **Buying Services**: Process service purchases using blockchain transactions


## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your Secret Key (`sk_prod_xxxx`). Include it in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_prod_xxxx
```

<Tip>
  For testing purposes, set your environment to development in the dashboard. 
  This will give you a secret key that doesn't require a valid transaction hash,
   making it easier to test the endpoints without needing to process actual transactions.
</Tip>



## Webhooks

When you buy a service, you'll receive status updates via webhooks at the URL you configured in your dashboard. Make sure to handle these webhook notifications to track the status of your service purchases.

## Rate Limits

API requests are limited to 100 requests per minute per API key.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Rate Limited
- `500` - Internal Server Error

Error responses include a JSON object with an `error` and `message` field:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "message": "The request was invalid"
}
```
